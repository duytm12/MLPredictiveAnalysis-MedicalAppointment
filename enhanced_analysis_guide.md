## How to Use This Script

### Option 1: Run the Complete Script
```bash
python task3.py
```
This will run the entire analysis and save all visualizations as PNG files.

### Option 2: Copy Sections to Your Notebook
Copy specific sections from the script into your Jupyter notebook cells:

1. **Copy Section 1** (Enhanced Imports) to replace your current import cell
2. **Copy Section 2** (Functions) to add the statistical analysis functions
3. **Copy Section 3** (Data Preparation) to enhance your data wrangling
4. **Copy Section 4** (Statistical Analysis) to add significance testing
5. **Copy Section 5** (SMS Analysis) to add the missing SMS analysis
6. **Copy Section 6** (Visualizations) to enhance your charts
7. **Copy Section 7** (Modeling) to add predictive modeling
8. **Copy Sections 8-10** for comprehensive conclusions and recommendations

## Key Requirements Met

### From answer2.txt:
✅ **CRISP-DM Methodology** - Implemented all 6 phases
✅ **Comprehensive Analysis** - Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
✅ **Statistical Rigor** - Chi-square tests, t-tests, confidence intervals
