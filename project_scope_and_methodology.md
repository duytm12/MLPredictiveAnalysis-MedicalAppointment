Description of Dataset(s)

D.  Write a description of the data by doing the following:

1.  Identify the source(s) of the data.

2.  Discuss why this dataset is appropriate for the stated goals of your project.

3.  Describe the data collection methods you used.

4.  Summarize your observations on the quality and completeness of the data.

5.  Discuss data governance; data privacy and security; and ethical, legal, and regulatory compliance considerations that relate to the dataset and the proposed project.

a.  Describe the precautions you will need to take when working with and communicating about the data for each of the considerations in part D5.
 

E.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
